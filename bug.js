This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions, especially on Android.  The issue is that `Dimensions.get('window')` or `Dimensions.get('screen')` might return incorrect values, particularly during the initial render or when the app orientation changes.  This can lead to unexpected layout issues or visual glitches.
